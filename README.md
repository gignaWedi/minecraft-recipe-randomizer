### Includes:

 - All Vanilla Recipes (randomized):
   - Crafting Recipes
   - Furnace Recipes
   - Smoker Recipes
   - Blast Furnace Recipes
   - Campfire Recipes
   - Stonecutter Recipes
   
 - Starter Recipes (constant):
   
   Craft up:
 
   - 1 Dirt to get a Crafting Table
   - 1 Cobblestone to get a Furnace
   - 1 Granite to get a Smoker
   - 1 Diorite to get a Blast Furnace
   - 1 Coal to get a Campfire
   - 1 Andesite to get a Stonecutter

#### To generate:
  
 - Execute the randomize_recipes.py
  
  OR
  
 - Run using terminal to generate specific seed (syntax: python randomize_recipes.py [seed])

It generates similiar to SethBling's MinecraftLootRandomizer, but
the pack will always chose and display a random seed, even if none is given.

(The first ten seeds will be in the examples folder for use as well)

Then just drag the zip file generated into the datapack folder of one of your saves. 

Use /reload (cheats required) or manually relog your minecraft world in order to use the datapack.
